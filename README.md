# Tank-Drive
Was a program for a project in school. Utilizes a gui from pygame just to verify input and pyserial to send data over to an arduino. When buttons are pressed the squares light up signaling data going to the arduino controlling the motors.

Project being put on standby due to issues with the physical portion of the project.
